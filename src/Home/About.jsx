              Manyavar began its journey as a thought in 1999 when Ravi Modi
              ventured into a family business which revamped men’s ethnic wear.
              What followed was a full swing retail operation thriving from 2008
              and since then the company has grown from a niche 90 employees to
              a blissful 5000+ employees associated with the brand.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Under the umbrella of Vedant Fashions Limited (formerly known as
              Vedant Fashions Pvt. Ltd.), Manyavar transformed men’s ethnic
              fashion wear into a signature statement. Soon the brand opened a
              much wider variety of men’s garments and accessories which
              rendered it as a one-stop shop for celebration wear. During its
              evolution, the label became synonymous with wedding wear; a
              one-stop-store, draping the world with joy and finest Indian
              elegance. Thus, Manyavar completed celebration!
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Manyavar’s timeless celebration collection includes exquisite
              Sherwanis, fine Indo-Westerns, Royal Bandhgalas, trendy
              Kurta-Jackets and matching accessories for life’s special moments.
              Not leaving behind the juniors, Manyavar started with their Kid’s
              Ethnic and Fusion wear line which was a delight to the little
              ones.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Timeless and iconic attires have cemented its reputation across
              the world with a commanding retail presence of 600+ stores in over
              240 cities and in 5 countries with 15 international stores in
              U.A.E., Canada, U.S.A and UK.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Transcending boundaries, Manyavar has emerged as one of the best
              places to work at with state-of-the-art infrastructures, friendly
              workforce, numerous employee benefits and smiling faces.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Manyavar movement has been a reflection of Ravi Modi’s grit,
              global vision and nurturing spirit teamed with Shilpi Modi’s
              creative spark. Their foresightedness driven together by a massive
              production and operation force has shaped a world-class
              organization with Bharatiya ethos and swabhiman.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Manyavar’s growth as a brand is also heavily attributed to its
              extensive focus on marketing and advertising that boasts of the
              highest advertising budget in the industry. While it started out
              as a wedding-wear brand, over time there has been a paradigm shift
              from wedding to celebrations on the whole and the new campaigns’
              focus on branding the label as Celebration wear.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              A winning streak in establishing the brand further was the
              on-boarding of leading names in Bollywood- Anushka Sharma, Kartik
              Aaryan, Ranveer Singh, Amitabh Bachchan, Alia Bhatt and Kiara
              Advani.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Leading the campaigns #Groomsquad and #TaiyaarHokarAaiye,
              heartthrob of the nation-Kartik Aaryan won the audiences’ hearts
              at one go! His youthful charm and his penchant for style are in
              complete synergy with Manyavar’s brand persona.
            </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Extending the legacy further, we on-boarded the living legend Amitabh
          Bachchan! He is an epitome of Indian culture and tradition, something
          which is at our core. Adding to the #DiwaliWaliFeeling, he is an ideal
          man to represent the whole idea and feeling.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Alia Bhatt’s association with Mohey was a big step forward for the
          brand. In the recent past, Alia has been revered for her remarkable
          performances and this belief in being her truest self has furthered
          the alliance. As a brand, Mohey too believes in embracing and
          celebrating every unique identity and Alia was the perfect match for
          our brand ethos.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Continuing the brand’s vision to associate with the best, we
          reinforced our #DulhanWaliFeeling by appointing the celebrated actress
          Kiara Advani in January ’23 as our new brand ambassador. Mohey, a
          brand that is known to celebrate not just weddings, but their brides
          and individuality too matches perfectly with Kiara who is an epitome
          of a radiant, confident, self-righteous and independent modern Indian
          bride.
